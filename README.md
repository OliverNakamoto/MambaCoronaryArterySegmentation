# MambaCoronaryArterySegmentation
Comparing U-Mamba and SegMamba for coronary artery seegmentation.

The trianing script is the final training script used for the SegMamba architecture, and resulted in the best performance for the architecture.

The inference and visualization scripts are the ones used for inferencing using a sliding window and then visualizing the predicted image.

The best model trained was too large to upload and hence it will be sent on request.

The Power Consumption tracking was implementing to track the carbon footprint of our training process in the project.

Finally, the Paperv1.1 is the report written based off of this investigation.
